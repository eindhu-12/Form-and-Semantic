            <h4><i>United States</i></h4>
            <p>I am a fine art photographer living and working in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. After receiving a degree in design and illustration I traded in my paints and brushes for film and the camera. My most recent project has been photographing the remote areas of Mexico and Latin America. I find the most interesting, intriguing places are off the beaten path and thus seldom visited by outsiders. I strive to find the magic and poetry that exists in everyday life, a harmony between magic and culture.</p>

            <h4><i>Hong Kong SAR China</i></h4>
            <p>I was born in Hong Kong in 1960. I obtained my medical degree in Hong Kong Medical College. I am now a practising ENT surgeon. I started my interest in photography since 2016. Rooting from some photo interest groups while I gradually found my special attentions in the stories of the nature and human cultures. I focused at one genre each time so that I could refine my techniques and my creative visions more specifically. My aim is to produce a self-satisfying portfolio at different timelines. These include insect photography, minimalistic winter landscapes, human culture in India and recently night sky landscapes. By diversifying my photo interest, I believe I can get the fun in photography and life can be more colourful and challenging with my camera.

            <h4><i>Italy</i></h4>
            <p>Roberta Vagliani (born 1987) is a photographer residing in a small town in the province of Mantua, Canneto s/O. The leitmotif of her shots revolves around three fundamental aspects: Emotion, Love, and Simplicity. She embarked on her photographic journey at the age of 17, delving into the realms of reportage and visual communication. For her, traveling signifies discovery and the longing to capture the emotions she experiences, aiming to evoke them in those who view her work. Photography serves as the medium through which she narrates, wordlessly, the scenes her eyes behold.
